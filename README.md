# Smart_Contracts_Measurment_System

### A Measurment System for Ethereum Smart Contracts

"The measurment system is to allow measuring the execution time (CPU Time) of Ethereum smart contracts. It measures the CPU Time for both contract-creation and contract-execution transactions. We developed the measurment system to be run on top of **Pyethereum client**; and we might extend it in the future to support other clients like Go." For more details we refer the reader to our paper **"Performance benchmarking of smart contracts to assess miner incentives in Ethereum"**.

#### Requirements:

* Install PyEthereum client in your local machine

* Install All python package required by the benchmarking system such as pandas etc

#### To run the code, type the following command: 

> python contractBenchSystem.py state.json

#### Comments:
* The data set and final results files are big and cannot be uploaded to Github. Instead, we upload a sample data set of 50K transactions (DataSet8.xlsx) and its results (DataSet8Results.xlsx). So, you can try the benchmark system and obtain the results.

* To get the full data set with its results, please contact me at alharbi.maher@gmail.com
